3. Going second against CPU going first

To compile
(Assuming you have access to C++, and a terminal (for command line ussage))

1. Clone this repo, then navigate to TicTacToeProject in your terminal
2. Using the command line, type "make"
3. After the code is compiled, you will have an executable called "Play"
4. Type "Play" into your terminal, and the game should run.
5. Follow the rules from there, if you dont know how to play tic tac toe -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe
6. When you're done you can type the command "make clean" to get rid of all the .o files
    in the directory and the "Play" executable.
    Of course, then you'll have to start back from instruction #2 above

 If you experience any issues on your side, you may need to add a compiling flag, 
    or edit parts of the code accordingly (e.g. maybe intialize some variables when they're declared),
    but feel free to let me know and send some suggestions
